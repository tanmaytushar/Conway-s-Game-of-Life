### Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It operates on an two-dimensional grid where each cell can either be alive or dead. The game evolves according to simple rules based on the state of neighboring cells:

-   **Underpopulation:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
-   **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
-   **Overpopulation:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
-   **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can exhibit complex and unpredictable patterns, making it a fascinating subject of study in computational theory and emergent behavior. 

This project includes an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in React  

### Getting Started

  

First, `npm install` run the n development server:

  

```bash
npm  run  dev
```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
